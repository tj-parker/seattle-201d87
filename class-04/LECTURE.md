## Warm Up

```javascript

let scores = [75, 10, 23, 76, 89, 31, 55, 87]; // length = 8
let highScores = [];

// use a loop, to read all numbers in the scores array, and put any number that is 75 or higher, into the high scores array.


for (let i = 0; i < scores.length; i++) {

  if (scores[i] >= 75) {
    alert('high score!! value of i: ' + i);
    // how do we put items into an array?
    highScores.push(scores[i]);
  }

}

```
